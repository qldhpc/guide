# A guide to using High Performance Computing.

* This guide is current a Draft *

This document presents a guide on how to use a High Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, or sometimes known as a supercomputer. Covered in this guide is a basic introduction to HPC though to some advanced concepts such as MPI and DMF.

This guide does assume a basic understanding of the Linux command line, and explanations of these basic commands will not be covered. There are numerous sources on the web covering basic command line. [Learn the Linux Command Line: The Basics](https://www.lynda.com/Linux-tutorials/Learn-Linux-Command-Line-Basics/435539-2.html) on Lynda.com is a good guide to get started.
